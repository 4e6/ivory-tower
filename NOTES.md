1. Title. Ivory tower
  - introduce yourself
  - get know with public
  - comparison of static and dynamic languages
  - what adjectives can describe each one
2. Outline
  - gist of a talk. first dynamic, then static
3. What
  - what is programming
4. A program
  - reflect on a background (people doing enineering)
  - how do you write one?
  - concept of abstraction
5. Abstraction
  - why do we need abstractions?
6. Quote E. Dijkstra
  - domain modeling
  - Occam Razor
7. A program (graph)
  - reflect on a background (program graph)
  - how do you know what this program is doing
  - read, evaluate
8. A new abstraction
  - we want to create a new program piece (module, function, etc.)
9. Quote D. Knuth
  - we want to build things (on top of each other)
  - we don't want our abstraction to leak
10. How
  - how do we build things
11. Data
  - 99% of program is data flow
  - Good place to introduce the concept of types
12. medical pipes slide
  - Typed (shaped) data flow
13. State
  - what happens if we access something from outside
14. OOP claim
  - is not about OOP, jus the language cannot manage state
15. State (fixed)
  - we can make state a part of a contract
16. Effects
  - we want to know that function can change outside world
17. Effects (fixed)
  - we also make effects a part of our contract
18. Data + State + Effects
  - to manage complexity of a program, we need to manage these
19. toy box slide
  - Refine concept of types
  - modeling with types
20. Static
  - when we talk about static languages, we talk about the language which is able to manage all three
21. Quote @kritzkreek
  - we read programs more often then write
  - types reflect a design (architecture) of our program
22. Static (back)
  - hierarchy of a functions
  - types vs. architecture
23. Dynamic
  - mutable data, global (side) effect
24. Quote R. Harper
  - dynamic language has less expressiveness
25. Dynamic (back)
  - dynamic language is a static language with a single type and global side-effect
26. Why
  - why people use different languages
27. Quote @Hillelogram
  - why types are hard
  - new concept you need to learn
  - type signature like a formula, you need to know the domain to read it
  - why the benefit is marginal
  - Java experience (oop claim meme)
  - people haven't used languages with expressive type system
28. Process
  - process has nothing to do with data+state+effect triple
  - process has nothing with abstraction
  - prevent people from doing mistakes
  - people still do the same amount of job
  - why thereare a lot of JS frameorks
29. Communication
  - communication is hard
30. Bosch
  - how dynamic people see static language
  - why confused?
31. Venn diagram
  - people talk different languages
  - dyn: "tell me about this"
  - nobody talks about pure functions, they are trivial, everybody like to show how they are able to manage effects (the hard part)
  - respect other culture
32. Tower + move right
  - tower people are snobs
  - talk jibberisch language about monads
  - stop talking about monads, (ordinary)
    * people doesn't even have such problem (of managing effects)
    * they doesn't even have a concept of an effect in their language
33. JS meme
  - although UI is much more complex domain than backend
34. Be kind to others
  - respect other people's work
35. MLP
  - and we'll be fine
  - that's all, thank you
